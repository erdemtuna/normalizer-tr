# Normalization reference

This document describes the single built-in normalizer, not selectable reading
profiles. `NORMALIZER_ID` / `normalizer_id` is diagnostic package metadata.
`complete` means all recognized normalization work was resolved; it is not a
claim about native-language or speech quality.

## Exact numbers and morphology

Magnitudes are strictly below `1_000_000_000_000_000_000`. Comma decimals have
1-9 fractional digits, read individually: `12,05` -> `on iki virgül sıfır beş`.
Explicit signs, including negative zero, are retained. Dot grouping must use
valid three-digit groups; bare `1.234` remains ambiguous without intent.

Integers, explicit ordinals and approved case/derivational suffixes share exact
number and spoken-tail helpers. Written-form pronunciation, the target spoken
stem and a derived stem are distinct: `25 TL'den` becomes `yirmi beş Türk
lirasından`, while `1.'nin` becomes `birincinin`. Emitted text is never reparsed
to infer suffixes. Arbitrary suffix chains and invalid allomorphs are unresolved.

Percentages accept prefix, spaced-prefix and trailing `%` with a valid exact
number and the same supported suffix rules:
`%37,5'lik` -> `yüzde otuz yedi virgül beşlik`;
`%3,25'ten` -> `yüzde üç virgül iki beşten`;
`12,5%'lik` and `% 12,5'lik` -> `yüzde on iki virgül beşlik`.
Duplicate notation and incorrect allomorphs do not become valid by moving `%`.

## Currencies, units and ranges

Only these currencies are supported, with 0-2 fractional digits and no rounding,
conversion, exchange-rate lookup or currency catalog inference:

| Currency | Labels | Major / minor words |
|---|---|---|
| TRY | `TL`, `TRY`, `₺` | `Türk lirası` / `kuruş` |
| USD | `USD`, `$` | `dolar` / `sent` |
| EUR | `EUR`, `€` | `avro` / `sent` |
| GBP | `GBP`, `£` | `sterlin` / `peni` |

Zero minor units are omitted. Unknown or malformed currency expressions remain
whole unresolved spans.

Supported currency labels may be compact or spaced: `25TL`, `25 TL`, `$25`,
`$ 25` and `25$`. Currency context also permits space-grouped money such as
`1 234,50 TL`, `$1 234,50` and `1 234,50TL`. The first group has 1-3 digits
without a leading zero; continuation groups have exactly three digits. Use one
consistent single separator: ordinary space (U+0020), nonbreaking space (U+00A0)
or narrow nonbreaking space (U+202F). Mixed separators, invalid group widths and
excess precision stay whole unresolved amounts. Tabs/newlines are not grouping
separators, and bare numbers or measurements do not gain space-grouping intent.
No global whitespace rewriting is performed.

Approved unit labels are exactly `kg`, `g`, `km`, `m`, `cm`, `mm`, `L`, `mL`,
`mg`, `µg`, `μg`, `gr`, `ml`, `lt`, `dk`, `sn`, `sa`, `m²`, `cm²`, `km²`, `m³`,
`°C`, `V`, `kW`, `kWh` and `GB`.
Aliases are explicit: there is no arbitrary case-folding or NFKC expansion.
Rates are only `km/sa`, `km/h` and `m/s`, using `saatte` / `saniyede`.
Number/label adjacency is supported: `5kg` -> `beş kilogram`.

| New label | Reading in numeric quantity context |
|---|---|
| `°C` | `derece Santigrat` |
| `V` | `volt` |
| `kW` | `kilovat` |
| `kWh` | `kilovat saat` |
| `GB` | `gigabayt` |

Bare symbols do not become unit readings. Existing case families are validated
against the approved spoken names: `75 kW'tan` -> `yetmiş beş kilovattan`;
`10 kWh'ten` -> `on kilovat saatten`. `KW`/`kw`, arbitrary suffix chains and
unapproved units remain unsupported.

Ranges keep exact endpoint order and use compact or spaced `-` / `–` plus an
approved unit or `kişi`, `adet`, `gün`, `yaş` context, or a whole Range hint. Bare `10-15`,
mathematical subtraction/equations and date/time/currency ranges are not guessed.
`10 - 15 kişi` -> `on ila on beş kişi`.

## Dates, clocks and abbreviations

Gregorian dates accept dotted day-month-year with a four-digit nonzero year, or
unsuffixed ISO dates, or fixed `DD/MM/YYYY` slash dates. A `tarih` / `tarihi` cue,
including its supported colon form, or a Date hint establishes intent. Clocks are valid 24-hour values with
a `saat` cue or Time hint.
`tarih 03/04/2026` -> `tarih üç Nisan iki bin yirmi altı`.
Bare slash notation remains unresolved; Fallback reads its written components
literally, not as a preferred/surface calendar date. US-order, two-digit-year
and clock-seconds interpretation are not added.

The bounded date-locative + whitespace + `saat` + whitespace + clock-locative
frame is also recognized. Date locative uses the spoken year; clock locative
uses the minute, or hour when `:00` elides minutes. Suffixed ISO/slash dates,
arbitrary suffix chains and invalid calendar/clock values stay unresolved.
`Toplam 25.` is not silently treated as an ordinal.

The explicit abbreviation inventory includes `Dr.` / `dr.` / `DR.`,
`Prof.` / `prof.` / `PROF.`, `Doç.` / `doç.` / `DOÇ.`, `vb.`, `TBMM`,
`PTT`, `NATO`, `IBAN` and `KDV`. Initialisms retain spaced letter readings.
Suffix support is bounded per entry, including approved `KDV'den` ->
`katma değer vergisinden`. Arbitrary abbreviation meanings are not inferred.

Unknown uppercase alphabetic prose such as `BUGÜN`, `İSTANBUL` and `ABC`
remains verbatim without an uppercase-only issue or automatic letter spelling,
in every policy. Recognized Roman-looking notation and protected identifiers
retain their distinct intent and fallback rules. This is not an acronym or
proper-name detector.

## Quotation and list boundaries

Smart double quotes and clearly paired smart/straight single quotes around
quantities stay verbatim: `‘25 TL’` -> `‘yirmi beş Türk lirası’`.
Apostrophes in supported suffixes remain part of their whole expression.
Ambiguous/unmatched forms are not forcibly treated as paired quotations.

Semicolon lists and clear comma boundaries after approved quantity labels are
separated without inventing spaces: `25kg,30kg` ->
`yirmi beş kilogram,otuz kilogram`.
Decimal commas remain numeric: `25,30kg` ->
`yirmi beş virgül üç sıfır kilogram`. This is not global splitting on commas.
URL/address punctuation and genuine identifier interiors stay protected.

## Phones, IBANs and Romans

Turkish national phones use `0 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2` grouping. International `+90`
forms say `artı doksan` followed by the ten written national digits; no trunk
zero is invented. Significant leading zeros in groups remain digitwise.
Plain ten digits require Telephone intent or a clear phone cue. Digits hints
remain digitwise, not telephone prosody. Subscriber assignment is not verified.

IBANs require the full uppercase `TR` + two check digits + 22 numeric BBAN
characters, canonical space grouping and modulo-97 validity. The public
`TR330006100519786457841326` fixture is a checksum example, not a verified
account. Fragments and malformed expressions remain protected. Boundary rules
keep following prose, abbreviations and independently valid quantities separate.

Romans must be canonical uppercase values 1-3999. A whole Roman hint or the
bounded ordinal context `Dünya Savaşı` / `yüzyıl` establishes reading intent.
Bare `IV`, `I.` and list markers are not guessed. `II. Abdülhamit` can use an
explicit hint; there is no general proper-name detector.

## Electronic text and symbols

The bounded grammar supports ASCII unquoted email, HTTP/HTTPS (scheme case
insensitive), `www`, and a bare domain with a `web` / `site` cue or Electronic
hint. Final TLDs are `com`, `net`, `org`, `tr`, `gov`, `edu`, `app`.

Alphabetic chunks keep source case. Schemes, ports, paths, query strings,
fragments, escaped bytes and digit order are spoken without fetching, decoding
or dropping components. `@` in a URI path is not authority userinfo. Quoted or
Unicode email, IDN, authority userinfo, unknown schemes/TLDs and bad escapes
remain unresolved as whole expressions. Prose hashtags and ampersands have
role-aware readings.

## Hints, coordinates and errors

Hints are Cardinal, Digits, Date, Time, Ordinal, Roman, Range, Telephone and
Electronic. They use nonoverlapping, grapheme-safe **original UTF-8 byte ranges**
over whole expressions. Cardinal intent permits explicit zero-padding. Digits
accepts optional initial plus and the supported space/dot/slash/hyphen/
parenthesis separators. A hint cannot legalize an invalid date, checksum or
malformed grammar, or cut a detected compound.

Already-NFC source is borrowed with its grapheme boundaries. Other input uses
NFC recognition with a mapping back to original graphemes. Verbatim/unresolved
text remains exact; no global lowercasing or Unicode compatibility rewrite.
Segments partition the original input contiguously and their text concatenates
to `normalized_text`.

Default Preserve returns useful partial work, `complete = false` and structured
issues. Reject returns `NormalizeError::Unresolved` with the same diagnostics
and no normalized result. Invalid input/hints/configuration, cancellation,
deadlines, resource limits and internal failures remain real errors in every policy.

| Limit | Bound |
|---|---|
| Original input | 32 KiB UTF-8 |
| Hints | 256 |
| Candidate records | 4096 |
| Logical result allocation | 512 KiB |

The allocation budget includes owned segment and final text plus result/
diagnostic structures. Empty/whitespace-only input, Bidi_Control and unsupported
controls are invalid. Cancellation/deadlines are cooperative between bounded
steps. Outputs contain input text, but the core does not log it; issue
explanations contain no copied input values.
